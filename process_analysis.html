    Argon Chalice: Spirits of the Forest

    Task - Redesign Argon Chalice, a linear narrative obstacle course style game

    Context - Academic, Foundations of Game Design, Fall 2023

    Time - One month

    Team - Simon Chettle, Ian Jakubowski, Zynab Fayyad

    Role - Character Design, Animation, Level Design

    Tools - Unity, Procreate, Adobe Illustrator

      Game Concept

      ​

      The original game we were tasked to redesign was based in a dungeon where the player's goal was to escape. We decided to change it to a platformer and create a new narrative, where the player is a wizard called by the Keeper of the Argon Chalice to restore harmony to a magical forest. The forest is in chaos caused by four elemental spirits of the Chalice - fire, water, air, and earth. The player's objective is to collect all the elemental spirits through a series of obstacles and place them back in the Argon Chalice to return the balance to the forest. 

      My Role

      ​

      My main role was to create the characters and their animations. Our team was initially inspired by the art style of the game Gris, so I started on character sketches that fit a similar style, while also looking for inspiration in games like Sky: Children of the Light and Journey. 

      ​

      The character sketches circled in red are what I thought would fit best with the Gris-style background my teammate had made. Team discussions lead to picking the wizard character circled in the first row. 

      ​

      Our programmer then suggested we try a pixel art style to ease the process of implementing levels into the game based on what he was learning how to do in Unity. The images below show that transition and my iterative process, plus my very first attempt at pixel art.

      Level Design

      ​

      I took part in some of the level design by storyboarding what obstacles I thought the level should include. I was only involved in the initial ideation process and not in the building and refinement of the levels later down the road. However, here are the examples of my ideas being used:

      Reward Schedules​

      Our project required we implement reward schedules and one way we did this was using a fixed ratio reward schedule.  We placed 3 chests in each level which contained different rewards for the player - either the player gains a heart that gives them more health, or a poster that shows a little lore of the forest. I designed 4 posters that were colour themed based on which level they appeared in. For example, the purple dusk poster with the Keeper and the 4 spirits looking out into the horizon would be found in the air level. 

      Reflection​

      I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, and I'm very proud of my teammates and I for creating a fully playable game in the time span we had. For it being my first try at pixel art, I'm satisfied with my work, but if I could go back, I would've liked my animations to be more dynamic. As for challenges I encountered, transferring my pixel art images from Procreate to Adobe Illustrator and then to Unity has its fair share of problems. It was all a learning process with creating sprite sheets (discolouration and sizing issues), but we got there in the end. 



      This project definitely required a lot of back and forth where I had to work with our programmer to get the sprites into the game, and our environment/UI designer to keep up the same visual style. Plus, just communicating as a team on the direction we wanted our game to go and meeting the requirements of the project.
