      <h2>Game Concept</h2>
      <p>The Herb Runner is a 2D angled-top down open world management simulator, where you play as herbalist who forages herbs as their daily task and fulfills orders for his customers. They are met with an imperitave task - to help a forest goddess prepare for the Summer Solstice Festival. </p>

    <h2>Character & Herb Designs: </h2>
      <p>In the early stages of the game, I was tasked to make the character and herb designs. With our narrative vague, I started with the two main characters, the herbalist and the goddess, and started creating unique magical herbs that would enchant the game world.</p>

    <h2>Level Design: </h2>
    <p>As we built our map and the herbs were given special properties, it was time to balance how the player goes about harvesting. The main obstacle for the player to gather herbs is how far they are from the spawn point (the herbalist shop). I gave each herb type (magical, medicinal, alchemy, and ritual) a value to quantify each herb's difficulty.</p>

    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>I'm happy with how our final game turned out, with the gameplay directly targeting our desired audience by blending management and exploration. If our team had more time, I would've liked to add more variation to the gameplay instead of the player having to complete the same set of actions every time. Dialogue choices and optional quests would definitely have fit our game theme while broadening the options for our players.</p>
