    <h2>Task:</h2>
    <h3>Present a design solution and its impact addressing user needs and fulfilling the client's objectives.</h3>
    <h2>Team:</h2>
    <h3>Wallace Chau, Ilyas Irfan, Zynab Fayyad</h3>
    <h2>What I Did:</h2>
    <h3>Character Design, Script Writing, Level Design, User Interface</h3>
    <h2>Our Process</h2>
    <h3>We arrived at four solutions: 
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Include function to post work samples to enhance and inspire community engagement.</li>
      <li>Provide feedback in a thread system and implement an upvote system so the community feels listened to.</li>
      <li>Have weekly design challenges to foster community interaction.</li>
      <li>Create an Inspiration page where users can see designs from all around the world.</li>
    </ol></h3>
     <!-- <h2>User Testing:</h2>
     <h3>Website Analysis, User Experience Design, User Interface Design, Video Editing</h3> -->
    <h2>Our Mockup</h2>

     <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <h3>This experience was challenging but a great opportunity to learn. With limited time, we were forced to think, ideate, and solve problems together in an efficient way. From my personal perspective, our result was successful, but we could have explained our choices for our designs better.</h3>
