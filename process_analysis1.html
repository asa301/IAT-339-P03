      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>Our research involved user research through creating personas, competitive analysis, and looking through the client's current website. We asked ourselves "how might we" questions to come up with our solutions:
      How might we inspire designers?
      How might we create a sense of community and belonging?
      How might we improve engagement? </p>

        <li>Have weekly design challenges to foster community interaction.</li>
        <li>Create an Inspiration page where users can see designs from all around the world.</li>

    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>This experience was challenging but a great opportunity to learn. With limited time, we were forced to think, ideate, and solve problems together in an efficient way. From my personal perspective, our result was successful, but we could have explained our choices for our designs better.</p>
